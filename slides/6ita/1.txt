cture: The Perceptron, developed by Rosenblatt in 1958, was an early attempt to create an artificial neuron capable of learning simple tasks. However, it had limitations, such as being able to solve only linearly separable problems. The XOR problem demonstrated this weakness, leading to Minsky and Papert's critique and a decline in ANN research funding. -->

cture: The backpropagation algorithm, introduced by Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams in 1986, allowed for more efficient learning in multilayer perceptrons. This algorithm, combined with the increase in computational power, led to a resurgence of interest in ANNs. -->
