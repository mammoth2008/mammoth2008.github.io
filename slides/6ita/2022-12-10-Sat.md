Tom Mitchell (Definition of the general learning problem):
A computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some class of tasks $T$ and performance measure $P$, if its performance a tasks in $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$

一个计算机程序在完成任务$T$之后,获得经验$E$,其表现效果为$P$;如果任务$T$的性能表现,也就是用以衡量的$P$,随着$E$的增加而增加,可以称其为学习
